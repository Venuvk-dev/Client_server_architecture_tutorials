# Client-Server Architecture - Weekly Tutorials

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to my weekly tutorials on **Client-Server Architecture**, part of my **L5 module at IIT**. Through this coursework, I will explore the fundamental concepts, components, and practical implementations of client-server models using Java.

## Topics Covered
- **Client-Server Architecture Components**
- **Types of Client-Server Models**
- **Networking Concepts** (Protocols, OSI Model, TCP/IP, IP classes, Subnets, ARP, NAT, Sockets, Socket Programming)
- **Fundamentals of Network Programming in Java**
- **Introduction to HTTP** (Methods, Requests & Responses, Cookies, Caching, DNS, HTTP in Java)
- **Web Services** (SOAP-based Web Services, WSDL, UDDI, RESTful Web Services)
- **Socket Programming & Multi-threading** (Building chat applications, message broadcasting, private messaging)
- **REST API Development** (JAX-RS, Annotations, Testing with POSTMAN, Exception Handling, Security)
- **Virtualization & Cloud Computing** (Hypervisors, vSphere, ESXi, Deployment Models, Serverless Computing)

## Practical Implementation
Each week, I will engage in hands-on exercises, including:
- **Building simple client-server applications**
- **Implementing RESTful APIs with JAX-RS**
- **Using Apache Tomcat for Java web applications**
- **Testing APIs with POSTMAN**
- **Exploring best practices for secure and scalable services**

This project will enhance my **networking knowledge**, **Java programming skills**, and **understanding of modern client-server systems**. Stay tuned for updates! ðŸš€
